                     education development have been gained through our  <br>
                     experience of working within the Southern African context <br> 
                     since our beginnings in 1996 <br>

                     context in which they were implemented <br>
                     <br>
                     MIET AFRICA has worked with Ministries of Education to design <br>
                     innovative approaches to support the strengthening of education <br>
                     systems and institutions, including a strong focus on teacher <br>
                     development, to ensure improved learner performance and  <br>
                     education for all<br>
